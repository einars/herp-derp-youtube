This is the "Herp Derp for Youtube" Chrome extension, vastly improved by removing the phrase "herp derp."

Original extension:
  http://www.tannr.com/herp-derp-youtube-comments/
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh

The extension converts all of the youtube comments to gibberish, consisting of the word "blah." This version retains the approximate structure and length of the original text.

I forked this repo because I wanted something to replace the content of Youtube comments (which are notoriously horrible). However, I did not want to use the phrase "herp derp" because it's flatly unfunny, makes me cringe a little bit inside, and most of all because it casually mocks folks with speech disorders and developmental disabilities. 

## Installation:

It's a hassle (it's worth it, though). As this is not published on the chrome
store, you'll need to muck around with downloading the extension files,
unpacking them somewhere, enabling the developer mode in the chrome extensions
page and use "Load unpacked extension..." button.
