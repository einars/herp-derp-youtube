This is the "Herp Derp for youtube" Chrome extension, vastly improved by smart herping-derping.

Original extension:
  http://www.tannr.com/herp-derp-youtube-comments/
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh

The extension converts all of the youtube comments to a gibberish, consisting of "herp" and "derp".

This version retains the approximate structure and length of the original text.

Examples:

Original: "More crap in the industry."
Herpaderped: "Derp herp herp the derp."

Original: "the beat is rad"
Herpaderped: "the herp is derp"

## Installation:

It's a hassle (it's worth it, though). As this is not published on the chrome
store, you'll need to muck around with downloading the extension files,
unpacking them somewhere, enabling the developer mode in the chrome extensions
page and use "Load unpacked extension..." button.
